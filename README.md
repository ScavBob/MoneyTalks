## General Info
This is my internship project over at [Technarts](https://technarts.com). This project was materialized because of the events and the betting that happened in the workplace.

## Introduction
MoneyTalks is a web-application that will allow friends to create events, put out bets on the condition they win and allow their other friends that didn't participate to bet on who would win.
